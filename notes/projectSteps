step 0: platform designer
step 1: control register
step 2: BRD register
Step 3: baud rate output > test bit
Step 4: Status register read
Step 5: Handle W1C & overflows
		Same fifo should be used for transmitting and receiving
		if(xFifo full and write) set fifo overflow
		W1C -> status reg -> clear fifo overflow
		how would you write that code:
		define a block that defined the fifo bits
			if  address and chip selected and write and bit 0 set,
				reset fifo?
Step 6: FIFO
	Tx Fifo connected to Rx input
