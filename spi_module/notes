if youre in auto cs mode, you need to pull CS low, transmit the bits, pull CS high. 

if not in AUTO CS MODE, cs has already been pulled low by someone else, so just transmit the bits out.

	if youre in auto cs mode, you have to be sure that there is one clock high of CS between pulses low. 

Three states: IDLE, TX_RX, CS_ASSERT
when to read?
	if empty, stay in idle.
	if not empty and !CS_AUTO -> start transmitting
	else if  EMPTY and CS_AUTO, go to  CS_ASSERT(There are 4 CS AUTO Values you have to select from(its basically a mux). Youre only transmitting on one of the CS's at once. The Control register will tell you the setting of the MUX. That value is CS_SELECT. CS_SELECT selects the mux and gives you one clean value of CS_AUTO value.
